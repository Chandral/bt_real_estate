## Installation
 - Install PostgreSQL. [Click here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to download PostgreSQL.
 - Create a virtual environment for Python. [Click here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to learn more about virtual environments in Python.
 - Clone this repository to your machine. [Click here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) and refer the "Cloning an Existing Repository" section of the page.
 - Once you have completed the steps above and activated the virtual environment in your command line, go to the folder which contains the '*manage.py*' file. Run the Django commands with 'manage.py' required to configure/migrate database, static and media files on your machine. E.g. ```python manage.py makemigrations```, ```python manage.py migrate``` ```python manage.py collectstatic```etc.
 - Please note that the '*settings.py*' file of the '*btre*' folder gets the data for sensitive fields such as SECRET_KEY, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD etc. from an external YAML file which is not included in this repo. The YAML file is excluded on purpose to protect the data from being publicly available on repos such as this one.
 - Once everything is setup correctly, run ```python manage.py runserver``` command from the same folder. Your app should be running locally on the default localhost port 8000.
